# Recall training

## Starting Slow
Throw food or a treat away from you

Soon as the dog picks up food say the recall word. You really just want to have this word associated with good things for a bit. Repeat this until it is boring. 

## Starting Fresh

If you already have a word you've been using, but the dog only shows up <90% of the time, say if there is a slice of pizza on the sidewalk, could you recall your dog to you? If the answer is no then it's time to start with a fresh term. 

Pick a word out of your normal vocabulary. The idea behind it is that you don't want to taint this word. More on that in the next section:

## 1:1:1 ratio

In order to strengthen the signficance of this term to your dog you need to strive for a 1:1:1 ratio of saying the command, having the dog recall, and then treating the dog. 

1 command
1 recall
1 treat 

As for when to treat: 

**Never have food visible until they've started the recall.**

Start mastering this command indoors before taking this to the streets. 

You want to strive for at least 90% success rate with recall, you're shooting for 100%. When you've reached at least 95%, then you can move on to Advancing the Recall. 

## The Recall Word checklist 

- [ ] Is my dog in danger? 

If yes, disregard everything below - save your dog or the person in danger. 

- [ ] Am I equipped to reward my dog? 

You need to be able to pay your dog if you want this to work. Use the delicious rewards in small doses. The goal is to taste something delicious, (ex: cheese). 

- [ ] Am I certain the dog will come when called? If not, is the dog on leash? 

If they are distracted do not ruin the recall word. If they are on leash, slowly retract the dog and treat when they come to you.

- [ ] Will coming to me be negative to my dog? 

Coming to you should never be detrimintal to the dog - such as recalling to get them to get their nails clipped. The dog should not experience something negative after hearing this word. 

## If the dog does not come: 

You should never repeat the command. If the dog does not come, do not say the word or show the treat. You can try other words or gimmicks to get them over, but do not repeat the recall command. 

On leash, you can pull the dog slowly (do not yank) towards and still reward the dog. 

## Advancing the Recall

Start this exercise on leash. 

Throw the food too far for them to reach. Let them try to get the food but do not enable them to get it. Wait a couple seconds, get their attention (do not use the recall word), when they come to you then you can release them, use your release word and go with them to get the food. 

Use what your dog wants as a reward but only after they come to you. This works with squirrels or anything they're after. 

### Easter Egg Hunt

You can go plant food outside that you know will be delicious for your pupper, when they see the treat, use the recall word 

You need full control over the variables until this becomes their default response to things they want. 

## Taking this to the dog park 

Start with training in an empty dog park, on leash. Leave when a dog shows up. 

After there are no failures on leash, then you can remove the leash. Still no dogs in the park at this point. 

# Dog Aggression

## A big note about small dogs

For genetic reasons, some smaller dogs become very reactive to larger dogs. When introducing recall training in the a dog park, it's important to make sure you are going to train with more compatible dogs (small dog parks are great for this). 

Even if there are dogs around, when your dog comes to you, they are rewarded. Give them time with dogs they are compatible with. 

If they do not come, move to something easier, such as more time with the dogs they enjoy playing with. 

You want to strive for at least 90% success rate with recall, you're shooting for 100%. When you've reached at least 95%, then you can move towards more wildcards at the dog park. Do not go in with dogs they are problematic with. 

The goal is to create an automatic response for the dog to come back to you which will lower their anxiety and reward them. You need to go at the dog's pace though til they are comfortable with bigger and bigger dogs.

## Read the dog's body language

Do not wait until the dog is barking or showing aggression to the dog. As soon as you see their body language show aggression, recall them. 

## Training with friends

Start 50 feet apart and walk in parallel. As soon as your dog sees the other dog, recall and reward. You can then walk a little bit closer together. Repeat as the dogs walk in parallel, moving slightly closer. You want the dog to associate seeing this dog with coming to you and being rewarded. 

Your goal is never to be at the point where they will bark or react. 

## Raising the bar (or Volume)

If your dog is reactive to doorbells, use your phone to play the doorbell sound at just 10% to see if they react, recall them. Gradually increase noise or proximity, but always set them up for success. 

If you gradually increase this sound over time and only reward when they do not react, eventually they should no longer react to that sound. 

## Training Tips

1. Keep the food in a pouch or out of sight until the goal is achieved.

2. Your dog make confuse treats with training. You'll want to make sure that just because you have treats doesn't mean they will get it. You can do this by keeping treat on you and going for a walk, but do not give them treat during that outing. Do this for a week then try it randomly from time to time. They should *only* get this treat when they listen to you. 

3. Never push your dog over the threshold. If you find yourself in a situation they will be afraid in, stop training and restart later. You can't train your dog when they are under duress. Look for tails posture and body language. 

4. You want to set your dog up for success. Set up the enviroment so that they can learn. 

5. Control the intensity where you can. When you increase the difficulty they should still not react. 

6. The best training should feel like a waste of time.
