# Recall training

Throw the food away from you

Soon as the dog picks up food say the recall word. 

**Never have food visible until they've started the recall.**

Say the word once when the dog has come back. That is the only time they should hear this word. 

Start mastering this command indoors before taking this to the streets. 


Pick a word out of your normal vocabulary. 


## The Recall Word checklist 

[] Is my dog in danger? 

If yes, disregard rules - save your dog or the person in danger. 


[] Am I equipped to reward my dog? 

You need to be able to pay your dog if you want this to work. Use the delicious rewards in small doses. The goal is to taste something delicious, (ex: cheese). 

[] Am I certain the dog will come when called? If not, is the dog on leash? 

If they are distracted do not ruin the recall word. If they are on leash, slowly retract the dog. 

[] Will coming to me be negative to my dog? 

Coming to you should never be detrimintal to the dog - such as recalling to get them to get their nails clipped. The dog should not experience something negative after hearing this word. 

## If the dog does not come: 

You should never repeat the command. If the dog does not come do not say the word or show the food. You can try other words or gimmicks to get them over, but do not repeat the recall word. 

On leash, you can pull the dog slowly (do not yank) towards and still reward the dog. 

## Advancing the Recall

Start this exercise on leash. 

Throw the food too far for them to reach. Let them try to get the food but do not enable them to get it. Wait a couple seconds, get their attention (do not use the recall word), when they come to you then you can release them, use your release word and go with them to get the food. 

Use what your dog wants as a reward but only after they come to you. This works with squirrels or anything they're after. 

### Easter Egg Hunt

You can go plant food outside that you know will be delicious for them. 

You need full control over the variables until this becomes their default response to things they want. 

## Taking this to the dog park 

Start with training in an empty dog park, on leash. Leave when a dog shows up. 

After there are no failures on leash, then you can remove the leash. Still no dogs in the park at this point. 

# Dog Aggression

## A big note about small dogs

For Hamilton, he has a case where he is reactive to larger dogs, so when introducing this training to the park with dogs, it's important to make sure he is going to train with more compatible dogs.

Even if there are dogs around, when the dogs comes to you, they are rewarded. Give them time with dogs they are compatible with. 

If they do not come, move to something easier, such as more time with the dogs they enjoy playing with. 

You want to strive for at least 90% success rate with recall, you're shooting for 100%. When you've reached at least 95%, then you can move towards more wildcards at the dog park. Do not go in with dogs they are problematic with. 

The goal is to create an automatic response for the dog to come back to you which will lower their anxiety and reward them. You need to go at the dog's pace though til they are comfortable with bigger and bigger dogs.

## Read the dog's body language

Do not wait until the dog is barking or showing aggression to the dog. As soon as you see their body language show aggression, recall them. 

## Training with friends

Start 50 feet apart and walk in parallel. As soon as your dog sees the other dog, recall and reward. You can then walk a little bit closer together. Repeat as the dogs walk in parallel, moving slightly closer. You want the dog to associate seeing this dog with coming to you and being rewarded. 

Your goal is never to be at the point where they will bark or react. 

## Raising the bar (or Volume)

Gradually increase noise or proximity, but always set them up for success. 

Example, your dog reacts to a doorbell. Use your phone to play the doorbell sound at just 10% to see if they react, recall them. 

Gradually increase this sound over time until they no longer react to the sound. 

## Training Tips

1. Keep the food in a pouch, out of sight until the goal is achieved.

2. Just because they have food doesn't mean they will get it. You having fun things on you is irrelevant. 

You can do this by keeping treat on you and going for a walk, but do not give them treat during that outing. Do this for a week then try it randomly from time to time. They should only get this treat when they listen to you. 

3. Never push your dog over the threshold. If you find yourself in a situation they will be afraid in. You can't train your dog when they are about to explode. Set up the enviroment so that they can learn. Control the intensity where you can. When you increase the difficulty they should still not react. 

The best training should feel like a waste of time. If you can recall them before they react and are just starting to repeat this.

Always train in such a way that your dog is comfortable with the situation.
